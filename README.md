# GonePhishing
## Idea
Our idea for this game came from the phrase, “Gone Phishing”. The idea of a 2d RPG game, with the concept of figuring out if emails were phishing or not was the early gameplay concept. Through brainstorming we eventually came to the idea of fighting other security threats including: apps stealing data, crypto currencies, and NFT’s, to name a few. Due to time constraints we decided to only implement the original idea and the data stealing idea. From there we went about making a story and the setting, and fully fleshing out our idea into a video game about Sid trying to help his grandma fix her printer.
## Framework and Tools
	The main tool we used was 2D Unity to make all the scenes in our game. To make the images, we used PixelMe and Pixel It to make online images pixelated. We also used Piskel to make animation and changes to the pixel art from the previous two websites.  With these tools we were able to make the story of “Gone Phishing” a reality.
  ## Gameplay
	The game starts on the intro scene. After clicking, the screen will change to a scene of Sid, our player character and his grandma outside her house. Interact with her three times. She asks you to fix her printer, but you have to go to work first. After walking into the office building you’ll enter a room with a fish in it. After interacting with the fish you’ll start his minigame. After reading the instructions the game will start. In the game against Phlip-Phlop, you’ll read emails and decide whether they are phishing emails or not. For every correct answer, you get 1 point. If you get one wrong, you get -1 point. As you choose emails, Philip-Phlop will say fish puns to try and distract you. If, after 10 emails, your score is positive, you’ll win the game. 
	From there you will enter the next floor by leaving the same way you came in. After walking into the clock you will enter Clik-Clok's game. The start will be very similar to the first: read the instructions and click to start. In this game you will have to click the ‘X’ button to delete Clik-Clok’s app off of your phone. After each round, Clik-Clok will hammer you with obscure internet jokes. After deleting him enough times, you will win his game.   
	Now you will enter the final floor, where the supposed “greatest threat” lies. When you enter the floor you will see buff doge, but when you walk to him, he will not fight you. Instead he will compliment you and present you with the third part of the manual without any conflict. Again you will leave the same way you came in.
	The final scene will take you back out of the office building again. From here you will go over and interact with the printer to fix it. If you interact with grandma before, she will just tell you to interact with the printer. After fixing the printer go over and interact with grandma. She will tell you how good you are, and then the end scene will appear. It should be the same as the title scene, but with the words “El Phin” written on it instead.
