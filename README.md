# GonePhishing
## Idea
Our idea for this game came from the phrase, “Gone Phishing”. The idea of a 2d RPG game, with the concept of figuring out if emails were phishing or not was the early gameplay concept. Through brainstorming we eventually came to the idea of fighting other security threats including: apps stealing data, crypto currency scams. Due to time constraints we didnt have the ablity to fully flesh out all our ideas, but we were still able to create a fully functional game with a complete storyline. 
## Framework and Tools
We used the 2D unity framework in order to achive a top down, pixelated style. We used PixelMe and Pixel It in order to create, animate, and edit the pixel art assets that we used in unity.  With these tools we were able to make the story of “Gone Phishing” a reality.
  ## Gameplay
The game starts on the intro scene. After clicking, the screen will change to a scene of Sid, our player character and his grandma outside her house.  She asks you to fix her printer, but you have to go to work first. After walking into the office building you’ll enter a room with a fish in it. After interacting with the fish and reading his dialog you’ll start his minigame. In the game against Phlip-Phlop, you’ll read emails and decide whether they are phishing emails or not. For every correct answer, you get 1 point. If you get one wrong, you get -1 point. As you choose emails, Philip-Phlop will say fish puns to try and distract you. If, after 10 emails, you have a high enough score, you’ll win the game. 
	From there you will enter the next floor where you descover a clock named clik-clok. After interacting with the clock you will enter Clik-Clok's game. The start will be very similar to the first: read the instructions and click to start. In this game you will have to click the ‘X’ button to delete Clik-Clok’s app off of your phone while the apps shuffle around. After each round, Clik-Clok will hammer you with obscure internet jokes. After deleting him enough times, you will win his game.   
	Now you will enter the final floor, where the supposed “greatest threat” lies. When you enter the floor you will see buff doge, but when you walk to him, he will not fight you. Instead he will compliment you and present you with the third part of the manual without any conflict. Again you will leave the same way you came in.
	The final scene will take you back out of the office building again. From here you will go over and interact with the printer to fix it. If you interact with grandma before, she will just tell you to interact with the printer. After fixing the printer go over and interact with grandma. She will tell you how good you are, and then the end scene will appear.
